# DoggoPass

--------------- LOGO PLACEHOLDER -----------------

> DoggoPass aims to be a free, open-source, self-hosted and most importantly, Rust written, alternative to BitWarden
> This means that apart from the APIs, it will feature it's own server and client applications

- The software is **NOT** considered to be usable **until** this line gets deleted


---

## Features to come:
- Server CLI managed
- Client CLI managed
- Working prototype
- Client authentication
- Database implementation
- Working database 

## Feature to come after the previous ones:
- URL identification
- Web implementation
- Website fields autocompletion
- *(probably not)* Firefox extension

---

As said before this is not a functioning software as is, nor it will become one soon
If anyone for whatever reason is reading this and wants to contribute I'll be glad, you can reach me at: comodinocode@proton.me

Credit to the idea goes to VaultWarden, as they have swiftly achieved the main goal of what I'm trying
